Do you pirate movies?
OF COURSE YOU DON'T! But maybe you have a directory with a bunch of video files in it, and you want to be able to play those videos in a browser from any device on your network.

Load the server in a file structure like ./server/Movies/all your video files.

Should support .mp4, .mkv, and ogg in Chrome (so you can cast it to your TV.)
